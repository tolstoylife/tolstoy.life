# Tags and HTML

## Tags

```markdown
#tag
#nested/tag
#tag-with-dashes
#tag_with_underscores

In frontmatter:
---
tags:

```

Tags can contain:
- Letters (any language)
- Numbers (not as first character)
- Underscores `_`
- Hyphens `-`
- Forward slashes `/` (for nesting)

## HTML Content

Obsidian supports HTML within Markdown:

```markdown
<div class="custom-container">
  <span style="color: red;">Colored text</span>
</div>

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  Hidden content here.
</details>

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>
```

## Comments

```markdown
This is visible %%but this is hidden%% text.

%%
This entire block is hidden.
It won't appear in reading view.
%%
```

## Horizontal Rules

```markdown
---
***
___
- - -
* * *
```

## Footnotes

```markdown
This sentence has a footnote[^1].

[^1]: This is the footnote content.

You can also use named footnotes[^note].

[^note]: Named footnotes still appear as numbers.

Inline footnotes are also supported.^[This is an inline footnote.]
```
