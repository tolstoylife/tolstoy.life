| User   | Human social interactions and relationships                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Example output

> * Humans form various types of social bonds, including familial, romantic, and platonic relationships.
> * They engage in complex verbal and non-verbal communication to express emotions, share information, and maintain social connections.
> * Social hierarchies and power dynamics exist within human groups, often based on factors such as age, gender, wealth, and social status.
> * Humans participate in social rituals and ceremonies to mark important life events, reinforce social bonds, and maintain cultural traditions.
>
> Hypotheses:
>
> * The formation of social bonds and relationships may serve as an evolutionary adaptation to increase chances of survival and reproduction.
> * Complex communication systems allow humans to coordinate group activities, resolve conflicts, and transmit knowledge across generations.
> * Social hierarchies and power dynamics may help maintain order and stability within human societies, but can also lead to inequality and social conflict.
> * Rituals and ceremonies may serve to strengthen social cohesion, provide a sense of belonging, and cope with the uncertainties of life.
