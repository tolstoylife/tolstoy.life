# Embeddings

Text embeddings are numerical representations of text that enable measuring semantic similarity. This guide introduces embeddings, their applications, and how to use embedding models for tasks like search, recommendations, and anomaly detection.

## Before implementing embeddings

When selecting an embeddings provider, there are several factors you can consider depending on your needs and preferences:

* Dataset size & domain specificity: size of the model training dataset and its relevance to the domain you want to embed. Larger or more domain-specific data generally produces better in-domain embeddings
* Inference performance: embedding lookup speed and end-to-end latency. This is a particularly important consideration for large scale production deployments
* Customization: options for continued training on private data, or specialization of models for very specific domains. This can improve performance on unique vocabularies

## How to get embeddings with Anthropic

Anthropic does not offer its own embedding model. One embeddings provider that has a wide variety of options and capabilities encompassing all of the above considerations is Voyage AI.

Voyage AI makes state-of-the-art embedding models and offers customized models for specific industry domains such as finance and healthcare, or bespoke fine-tuned models for individual customers.

The rest of this guide is for Voyage AI, but we encourage you to assess a variety of embeddings vendors to find the best fit for your specific use case.

## Available Models

Voyage recommends using the following text embedding models:

| Model              | Context Length | Embedding Dimension            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
